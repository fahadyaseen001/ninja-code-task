This repository is my submission for the Full Stack Developer challenge at Ninjas Code. It demonstrates my implementation of scalable and responsive web designs, focusing on food delivery functionality.

## Project Overview üöÄ
The application allows users to browse nearby resturant & view their information. It utilizes Google Maps & OpenStreet Map API for location services,Apollo Client for managing GraphQL data of resturants,tested on Cyprus(e2e with Unit Testing) & Deployed on Vercel.

## Features ü§ñ
- Location Fetching Features
- Browse nearby restaurants & countries using Google Maps
- View restaurant details and menus
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Thought Process For Understanding The Task & Coding It üí≠

-Started with understanding all the necassary requirements of the task assigned

-Wrote those requirements on paper for more clarity

-Understood the flow of task mechanism by exploring and playing around with real deployed website provided in the task

-Reviewed the codebase of Enatega Multivendor Web Original Repo for further understanding & clarity on provided task.

-Intialized my task repo with NextJs 15 ( App Router ) & setup all the necassary libs ReactPrime,Apollo-Client & Cypress

-Divided the task into small parts of website ( Header,Body,Footer ) and intialized folder structure for project with proper coding naming & convention practises with

-Used NextJs App Router for project files & Navigation

-Utilized Context for State Management due to smaller scope of the task

-Utilized OpenStreet Map for static map coordinates due to its non api key requirement & utilized Google Maps with its Api Key for implementing maps along with exploring map options as per use case

-Add .env.local file for api key security & envoriment (local & production) implementation.

-Using Graphql functionality to pass data to the client side using the api endpoint url

-Used Apollo Client for quering resturant data inside resturant cards

-Defining types/interfaces to ensure type safety on client side upon arrival of data using Graphql

-Ensure Responsiveness across all devices layout (mobile,tablet & web)

-Optimized the performance by handling all the edge cases and implementation loading state handling along with error handling 

-Using Chrome Dev Tool to ensure both responsiveness & performance with low LCP,CLS & INP indexes value ensuring high performance 

-Ensuring in App performance using react.Memo,useCallback hooks

-Utilizing SSR for optimization in NextJs

-At last wrote test cases - e2e for unit testing of the functionality (3 test cases passed ‚úÖ/ 2 test cases failed ‚ùå ) - Cause of failure due to api endpoint url not sending complete data & missing attributed inside resturant cards

-This was the approach i took inorder to complete the task assigned.
